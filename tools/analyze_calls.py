# Performs analysis of every function in the asm directory. For each function, finds
# all functions called by this one, and all functions that call this one.
# By default, this will create several thousand SVG files.
# Run with --dry to generate data for all files as testrun, without outputting files.
# Run with --ultradry to just do the function analysis, but skip generating SVG.

# This will print the time taken for each step of the process, which is helpful for
# benchmarking, as well as determining if execution is taking longer as the repo grows.
# On my machine, all steps prior to SVG generation take less than 1 second, and SVG
# generation takes 30 seconds (regardless of dry mode). Note times printed are cumulative
# in the sense that the printed time is not per-step, but is time since execution start.
