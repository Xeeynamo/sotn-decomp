    // BUG: Array out of bounds writing. Possible explanation:
    // unkB0 was originally a 4-element array. This loop would iterate
    // through the 4 elements and write each to zero.
    // At some point, unkB0 got split to two arrays, unkB0 and unkB4.
    // Now we zero out both arrays. But since each one is only 2 elements,
    // the loop should only be `i < 2`. They forgot to change it. This means
    // that for i = 2 and i = 3, the unkB0 writes are writing into unkB4,
    // and the unkB4 is writing totally out of bounds.
    // As far as we know, this bug does not have any consequences.
