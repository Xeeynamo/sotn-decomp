# Contributing to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Decompilation

Thank you for your interest in joining our project's journey!

To get started with the project, the best way is to familiarize yourself with how to [build](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/wiki/Build) the project and understand the process of [decompiling](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/wiki/Decompilation).

While it's not a requirement to have fully played the game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night before you begin, it's beneficial to know the game in order to have a broad understanding of what the codebase does.

We maintain a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that can serve as potential entry points to start contributing.

Additionally, if you are new to the project, a great first contribution could be renaming functions or variables. While many parts of the game are already decompiled, many of those decompilations are using placeholder names, because it is not always obvious what a given function is for. If you can select a function in this repository with a name like `func_8010ABBC` and determine what its purpose is in the game, it would be great to submit a PR which would give it a descriptive name. The same applies for variables, which are usually initially of the form `D_8007A2B4`. Again, if you can determine what a variable is for and rename it in the codebase, it would be a very helpful first contribution, with the bonus of not requiring knowledge of Assembly code.

Please note that, at this time, we are NOT accepting Pull Requests that only aim to fix spelling errors or reorganize sentences, as we prioritize contributions with a more significant impact.

If you have any further questions, please refer to our [README](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp#readme) for contact information and additional resources.
