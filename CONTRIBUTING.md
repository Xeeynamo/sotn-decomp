## Game Familiarity
While it's not mandatory to have fully played Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, having a good understanding of the game can be beneficial for comprehending the codebase.

## Good First Issues
We maintain a list of "Good First Issues" that are suitable for newcomers to the project. These issues serve as excellent entry points for contributing.

## Renaming Functions and Variables
A great initial contribution is renaming functions and variables. Most of these names are placeholders, and the initial priority is functionality rather than readability. Renaming them involves understanding their purpose and giving them more meaningful names. This task doesn't require programming knowledge and is an ideal first contribution. Placeholder names often start with func_, D_, or Unk, and you can identify their purpose by plugging them into a PlayStation 1 debugger.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: We require contributors to sign a CLA before their contributions can be accepted.
- **Pull Request Approval**: Contributions should be reviewed and approved by maintainers before merging. Your contribution should not be merged without review.
- **Code Quality**: Follow coding standards and ensure your code is well-documented.
- **Testing**: If relevant, test your changes to make sure they work as expected.

## Spelling and Sentence Fixes
Please be aware that, at this time, we do not accept Pull Requests that only aim to fix spelling errors or reorganize sentences. We prioritize contributions with a more significant impact.
