# Contributing to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Decompilation

Thank you for your interest in joining our project's journey!

To get started with the project, the best way is to familiarize yourself with how to [build](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/wiki/Build) the project and understand the process of [decompiling](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/wiki/Decompilation).

While it's not a requirement to have fully played the game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night before you begin, it's beneficial to know the game in order to have a broad understanding of what the codebase does.

We maintain a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that can serve as potential entry points to start contributing.

Please note that, at this time, we are NOT accepting Pull Requests that only aim to fix spelling errors or reorganize sentences, as we prioritize contributions with a more significant impact.

If you have any further questions, please refer to our [README](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp#readme) for contact information and additional resources.
